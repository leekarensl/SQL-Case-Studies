# Case Study 2 - Pizza Runner
*This case study is part of the 8 weeks SQL challenge which you can find details [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)

## Introduction
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Problem Statement and Available Data
Danny is  very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth. He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram (see below) of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.
